# GHax
This Python script is a Counter-Strike 2 cheat that provides ESP features, a trigger bot, and other in-game overlays. It utilizes memory manipulation and a GUI to help assist users.

## What To Do To Make It Work?
If you haven't done so already, make sure to download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Additionally, you will need to install the packages required for this. To do this please download both GHax.py, and the requirements.txt.
Then, make sure pip is installed already and then paste this into command prompt as admin:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
After installing the dependencies, run the script using:
``python GHax.py``

**Usage:**
Before running the script, ensure that Counter-Strike 2 is already running. It is also essential to run the script with administrator privileges.

**Credits:**
I've improved the GUI of the menu, but GHax was initially created by [glennf](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counter-strike-2-releases/633657-cs2-python-cheat.html).
